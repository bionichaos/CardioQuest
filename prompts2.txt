// Double-check that the waveformTypes array is properly initialized and updated for each segment.

// Verify that the tagged array is correctly tracking which waveform segments have been tagged.

// Make sure that the click event coordinates are being calculated correctly to determine the waveform index being clicked.

// Check for any unintended mutations or reassignments of variables that might be affecting the score calculation.

// Ensure that the generateNewWaveformSegment function returns the appropriate waveform type (1 for abnormal) when an abnormal waveform is generated.

// Make sure the waveform is selected based on the 60% abnormal
// within the sixty percent the abnormal waveform to be selected randomly.

// Before the mouse is pressed, do not reveal actual colors based on currentWaveformType. 
// All colors should be default before the mouse is clicked.

// Generate the complete code without any missing bits or placeholders. 
// include all the constants and functions. Include all the code that remains the same.

// The drawing on canvas suddenly changes when a new waveformFunction is selected.
// Make sure the current waveform completes showing and then roll in the next one.
